# RaspiBoxes
Class project about a box pushing game

The goal of the game is to push a box around the map to the objective while avoiding obstacles.
This project is part of a school project on a raspberry pi 3B.
The game will take place on the LED screen of the sense hat.
But we plan to make it playable on the monitor as well.
